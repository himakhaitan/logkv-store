# Commit Guidelines
Consistent and descriptive commit messages make collaboration smoother, changelogs clearer, and development faster.
This project follows the **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)** standard.

## Why This Matters

- **Automation:** Enables semantic-release, changelogs, and versioning tools to do their job.  
- **Clarity:** Makes the history easy to scan and understand.  
- **Consistency:** Every contributor, every repo ‚Äî same format.  
- **Professionalism:** Maintains a clean commit history that speaks for itself.

## Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages in the following format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>
```

### Types:

| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

### Scope
The scope describes the section of the codebase affected by the change.

#### Examples:
```
feat(auth): add password reset
fix(api): handle null responses correctly
docs(readme): clarify setup instructions
```

## Emperative Rules
- Use imperative mood ‚Äî ‚Äúadd‚Äù not ‚Äúadded‚Äù or ‚Äúadds.‚Äù
- Keep it short (max ~100 characters)
- No capitalization or punctuation at the end.
- Describe what and why, not how.

#### Bad
```bash
fixed bug
```

#### Good
```bash
fix(api): prevent crash when token is missing
```

## Commit Body (Optional)
The body provides more context. It‚Äôs optional but recommended for non-trivial commits.

Guidelines:
- Explain the motivation behind the change.
- Mention any limitations or related follow-up work.
- Wrap lines at ~100 characters.

Example:
```bash
feat(storage): migrate from localStorage to IndexedDB

The new implementation improves performance for large datasets.
Also added a migration utility for legacy data.
```

## Breaking Changes
If your change breaks backward compatibility, mention it in the footer starting with `BREAKING CHANGE:`.

Example:
```
feat(auth): switch JWT library

BREAKING CHANGE: tokens are no longer compatible with previous versions.
```

## Examples of Good Commits
```bash
feat(api): add rate limiting to endpoints
fix(auth): prevent login crash on empty password
docs(readme): update local setup steps
refactor(core): simplify middleware chain
chore(deps): bump <package> to 1.6.0
```

## Pro Tips
- Squash trivial commits (like fix typo) into meaningful ones.
- Use GitHub Draft PRs for ongoing work.
- Don‚Äôt commit generated files or large binaries unless necessary.
